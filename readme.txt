This is one if the very first things that I
made in Python and PyGame. its a very basic
pong clone that has no menus but scoring and
rudimentary enemy AI. For the enemy, they just
move according to the ball's y position. 

Looking back it's obvious how much of a 
beginner's effort this really was. Basically
every variable is global in scope. I also 
decided to use the law of reflection with
trig, polar coordinates, and the paddle's
velocity for collisions whereas now I'd 
probably implement that with vector math and
use the distance relative to the center of 
the paddle to calculate the change in
direction which is a more typica approach.
